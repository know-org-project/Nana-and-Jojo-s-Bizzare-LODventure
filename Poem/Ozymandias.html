                "Ozymandias" is a sonnet written by the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792&#8211;1822). It was first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of The Examiner of London. The poem was included the following year in Shelley's collection "Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems".
                </span>
        <span class="note">The poem explores the worldly fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.</span>
        <span class="note">
                In "Shelley's Poetry and Prose: Authoritative Texts Criticism", Donald H. Reiman and Sharon B Powers re-edited all the texts from primary sources. All the poems and prose pieces have been thoroughly annotated with all biographical, historical, topographical, and literary allusions identified on its context.

      <h2>Ozymandias</h2>
      <p>
                I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
                Who said&#8212;&#8220;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
                Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br/>
                Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
                The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
                And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br/>
                My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br/>
                Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
                The lone and level sands stretch far away.&#8221;<br/>
